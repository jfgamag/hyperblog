Amazing blog for the Git and GitHub course

This course will help me achieve my goals, which are get a joinn in the tech industry and continue to learn about the different coding languages. When I first heard about coding it was while I was studying in my university, back then I thought this isn't for me, fast forward 9 years later I lost my job and my little sister was learning Python, so I thought "Let's give it a try". Since then I have gained some knowledge an experience and hope to learn more.
Coding is nice and easy, sadly I dind't learn before, but it doesn't matter now.
